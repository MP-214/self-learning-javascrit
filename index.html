		<h2>what is Hoisting?</h2>
		<p>
			Hoisting in javascript means it led the function and variable at the top
			of stack it means at the time of execution firstly in call stack
			GEC(global execution context is pushed) so in GEC there are 2-phase
			:1-->creation-Phase(Memory) and 2-->execution-phase(Code) --in creation
			phase all the global variable are represent as undefined and for function
			it return a complete function means copy of functional statement is
			attached to it. --in execution phase the variable or function gets invoked
			and values get assign to variable and function Note:Hoisting won't take
			place in case of let and const variable Remember:for every function
			invocation a excution context is created
		</p>
		<h2>what is lexical-scope and scope chain?</h2>
		<p>
			so Lexical scope is a concept applicable for nested function like currying
			function ,closure ,etc. actually it very nice concept when function is
			detached from its global space then also it can access value from its
			outer function how it access is because of lexical scope so what happen is
			that at the time of execution the most inner function checks variable in
			locally if it is not found in its local memory then it check to its
			reference to the parent of lexical environemnt again if its doesnt found
			in its parent lexical environemnt then it will check to its grandparent
			lexical environment ..it goes on checking up to its global exceution
			context get completed. the method of chaining a lexical scope of
			parentenvironemnt is know as scope chain
		</p>
		<h2>what is closure?</h2>
		<p>
			So closure is very important concept in javascript and its very useful
			closure in a function is used to remember a value that can be used later
			by some other function. so in given example the inner function is get
			dettached from its global environment where outer function and its
			variable present so what it do the inner function bind together with its
			parent lexical environement so even though inner function is return it
			gets in different scope and outer function is executed completely thought
			the inner function can access value of x from its parent lexical
			environment. and the variable x in inner function has Refernece to the
			outer variabe x, so value doesnt persist its refernece persist. uses of
			closure: 1.module design pattern 2.curring function 3.function like once
			4.hiding and enapsuation of data to maintain data privacy
		</p>
		<h2>what is Block scope and Shadowing</h2>
		<p>
			Block:The group of statement inside a curly braces where javascript
			expects a single statement from it. Scope:where the variable and functions
			are decalared are scope to the block. With help of hoisting we can
			identify that the let and const variable are assigned in block scope where
			var varibale are assigned to undefined in global scope and if let and
			scope defines in global space then it will go under script scope which is
			global scope for let and const that's why let and const hoisting cant be
			happen because its different from global scope. let and const can shadow
			var and itself variable but var variable can't shadowing let and const its
			illegal
		</p>
		<h2>what is let and const and temporarl dead zone</h2>
		<p>
			let and const are blocked scope varibale where separate memory has been
			created (i.e script(global)) . these
			<strong>variable are hoisted </strong> and its value are set to undefined
			at initial phase i.e creation phase but we can't access its memory before
			the varibale is initialize. Here comes temporarl dead zone into play ..It
			is a Zone the time between the variable is decalred and till the variable
			is initailized is known as temporarl dead zone. the phase from assigning
			to initialzing is known as temporarl dead zone. we can't access any let
			and const variable if it is under temporarl dead zone Note:- you can't use
			same variable name in same scope except in var case. let variable can be
			declare but const varible can't be re-declare
		</p>
		<h2>what is first class function or first class citizen</h2>
		<p>
			Because can be return as value.like function expression e.g var a=function
			xyz(){ console.log("hello"); console.log(xyz) } in this type of function
			are not hoisted because the var a is undefined at global space and
			function xyz() is not created at global space it create separate memory
			.so it can't be called at global space directly but it can be called
			locallay inside a function as showin in log. --function can be pass as
			argument also function can return another function.
		</p>
		<h2>what is CALLBACK?</h2>
		<p>
			callback is a function that can be called later throught the program when
			it needed.A callback is a function that will be executed after another
			function gets executed.

			<li>Mainly it is used to handle asynchronus call</li>
			<li>
				In web api we can find cllbacks like in settimeout function also in
				addEventlistener call.
			</li>
		</p>
		<h2>what is higher order function?</h2>
		<p>
			Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as
			arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions. Higher
			order functions are a result of functions being first-class citizens in
			javascript.
			<li>
				HOC function takes function/component as argument and return the same
				function/component along with some additional functionality or
				superpower
			</li>
		</p>
		<h2>what is Polyfill?</h2>
		<p>
			It is a browser fallback if supposed there is no inbuilt bind function
			,then we can use our custom bind function .E.g is present into script.js
		</p>
		<h2>what is Debouncing?</h2>
		<p>
			Debouncing is a concept to limit the rate of certain function what it will
			do . It will take 2 parameter one is function and another one is timer.
			Basically it is time difference between two time function is greater than
			delay it doesnt make any uncessary call function .e.g searchbar in
			e-commerce website
			<input type="text" onclick="getData()" />
		</p>
		<h2>What is Currying?</h2>
		<p>
			Currying is an advanced technique to transform a function of arguments n,
			to n functions of one or less arguments. For Example, if we have a
			function f(a,b) , then the function after currying, will be transformed to
			f(a)(b). By using the currying technique, we do not change the
			functionality of a function, we just change the way it is invoked.
			<li>it can be done by using binding and closure</li>
